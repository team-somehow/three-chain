# Three Chain

A Plug and Play Supply Chain Solution

## ThreeTrust

**Escrow for goods transfer:** The solution provides an escrow service for goods transfer from the manufacturer to the buyer. This ensures that both parties can trust each other, and the payment is released only when the goods are delivered as per the agreed-upon terms.

**Reverse logistics:** The solution uses ERC721 tokens for reverse logistics. This allows the parties involved in the supply chain to track the product's movement from the buyer to the manufacturer. This helps in identifying the source of any issues or defects in the product and helps in resolving them quickly.

**Quality assurance:** The regulator assures the quality of each batch of the product.

**Aadhar QR KYC**: All actor's information is verified using 'Secure QR Code Reader'.

## ThreeTrack

**Location tracking:** The solution allows tracking the product's location in the supply chain at any given time. This helps in identifying any delays or bottlenecks in the supply chain, enabling the parties involved to take corrective measures.

**Transfer signatures:** The solution stores the signature of each transfer. This helps in identifying any fraudulent activity in the supply chain and increases transparency.

**Batch management:** The solution divides the product into batches and mints them using ERC721a tokens. This saves gas costs exponentially and helps in managing the inventory effectively.

## ThreeFinance

**Supplier loans:** The supplier can request loans from manufacturers that are tracked and ensured by the smart contract. This ensures that the supplier can meet the demand for the product and keeps the supply chain running smoothly.

**Secure payments:** The solution ensures secure and transparent payments between the parties involved in the supply chain. This helps in reducing the risk of fraud and increases trust between the parties.
